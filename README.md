# OJO Local Indicators - Sussex

**_Public repository for hosting the outputs of the OJO local indicators project working with the Sussex Chamber of Commerce._**

## Welcome!

This repository contains the code for a short project using the Open Jobs Observatory to better understand skills demand in Sussex for the Sussex Chamber of Commerce.

In this project we produced a series of visualisations based on indicators that describe:

- Growth in vacancies across the UK
- Skills demand in Sussex compared to the Rest of the UK
- The occupations and indistries most advertised in Sussex compared to the rest of the UK
- A deep dives for skill groups that correspond to the Chamberâ€™s key sectors
- What percent of a UK sample of jobs are green (includes non-green jobs in green industries and green jobs in non-green industries)
- A deep dive into transversal skills across the UK and in Sussex

The insights from this project can be found on the [Local Skills Improvement Plan](https://www.sussexchamberofcommerce.co.uk/Education%20Skills) on the Sussex Chamber of Commerce website.

## Contents

The code to produce the visualisations can be found in sub-folders in the [analysis folder](https://github.com/nestauk/ojo_local_indicators/tree/uk_wide/ojo_local_indicators/analysis).

- [**Sussex spotlight**](https://github.com/nestauk/ojo_local_indicators/tree/uk_wide/ojo_local_indicators/analysis): Looking at skills demand in Sussex (based on a sample of job ads.
- [**UK wide**](https://github.com/nestauk/ojo_local_indicators/tree/uk_wide/ojo_local_indicators/analysis): Looking at growth in job ads, industries and skill across the UK.
- [**Deep dives**](https://github.com/nestauk/ojo_local_indicators/tree/uk_wide/ojo_local_indicators/analysis): Focusing on digital, healthcare and engineering skill groups.
- [**Green jobs**](https://github.com/nestauk/ojo_local_indicators/tree/uk_wide/ojo_local_indicators/analysis): Visualisations produced to show percent of green jobs per industry and occupations.
